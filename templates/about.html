My name is MD Samiul Huq and no, I'm not a physician as you might infer from my initials. I am an aspiring web developer, student and generalist, who is relatively new to the world of web.</br></br> I'm originally from Bangladesh but I was worn in Washinton D.C, USA. However I spent most of my life outside of the US but here I am now, currently a Freshman at the Pennsylvania State University, working towards my Computer Science degree.
